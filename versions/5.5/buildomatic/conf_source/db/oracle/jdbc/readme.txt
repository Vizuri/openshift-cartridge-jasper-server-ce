The Oracle JDBC driver can be downloaded using the URL shown below:

  http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/indexes/downloads/index.html

It is typical to pick the most recent version number matching the 
Oracle database version installed at your location. 

Additionally, it is best to get the most current driver from the Oracle
website in order to get the most current driver bug fixes. 

Default driver used is:

  ojdbc5-11.2.0.jar
